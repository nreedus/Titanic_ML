#### # Summary

The maiden voyage of the Titanic; made popular by James Cameron's epic 1997 film, is one of the most infamous tragedies in human history. The "unsinkable" oceanliner struck an iceberg and sank to the bottom of the Atlantic killing 1,502 of its 2,224 passengers and crew.  

Today, with the help of the ship's manifest, data analysts and data scientists from around the globe are able to discover numerous insights by appyling machine learning algorithms to predict who lived and who ultimately died onboard the RMS Titanic. 

My goal here is to use feature engineering to viusalize the distinguishing factors between the passengers more likely to survive the shipwreck from those who ultimately perished.
